 * Foundation-stage Playwright config. Per contracts/VISUAL-REGRESSION-CONTRACT.md:
 * comparisons are meant to run CI-vs-CI only, on a pinned runner image —
 * that pinning happens in the CI workflow (.github/workflows/ci.yml), not
 * here. This config fixes the local/CI-shared mechanics: browser project,
 * base URL, and the webServer that serves the actual production build
 * (never `astro dev`) so what is tested matches what ships.
