# Deployment Contract

**ID:** CONTRACT-DEPLOYMENT-01
**Status:** FROZEN · Stage 3 (Contract Freeze)
**Purpose:** Fix the deployment target, static-output expectations,
function boundary, and rollback posture before any deployment config
exists.

## Outputs / Frozen deployment model (source: `ARCHITECTURE-PROPOSAL-V3.md`
§12, `EV-20260826-018`)

```
HOST = Cloudflare Pages
STATIC_OUTPUT = apps/web build output (Astro `output: 'static'`)
FUNCTIONS = Cloudflare Pages Functions, available under the same project,
            NOT ACTIVATED until a real form exists (FORM-CONTRACT.md)
PREVIEW_DEPLOYMENTS = one per PR, standard Cloudflare Pages behavior
PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT = on merge to the default branch
CI_INTEGRATION = GitHub Actions builds and runs the full CI-CONTRACT.md
                 gate set on every PR before a preview/production
                 deployment is considered valid
```

## Environment configuration

- No environment variable carries a real secret at this stage (no secret
  is currently required by any implemented functionality).
- When a form is implemented, its Cloudflare Functions environment
  bindings are documented here as an amendment, never invented in advance.
- `.env.example` (once created) documents variable names/purposes only.

## Secrets

- No secret is committed to the repository.
- Cloudflare account/API credentials (for CI-driven deployment, if used)
  are stored in GitHub Actions secrets, never in a tracked file.
- `CI-CONTRACT.md`'s secret-scan gate is the enforcement mechanism.

## Fonts (deployment-relevant, cross-referenced from `ASSET-CONTRACT.md`)

- Lato/Montserrat (or their eventual UKBT replacements) are self-hosted
  under their OFL terms as part of the `apps/web` static output — never
  loaded from `fonts.gstatic.com` at runtime, resolving the GDPR/
  third-party-request finding (`U-18`, `knowledge/06 privacy`).

## Rollback / recovery

- Cloudflare Pages retains prior deployments; rollback is a target-the-
  previous-deployment operation, not a rebuild — this is standard
  Cloudflare Pages behavior, not a bespoke mechanism this project builds.
- A production deployment that fails a post-deploy smoke check (Stage 4
  addition, not yet implemented) is rolled back to the last known-good
  deployment rather than left live and "fixed forward" under user traffic.

## No runtime services beyond the approved architecture

- No database, no server process, no additional runtime service is
  deployed beyond: static asset hosting + (once activated) Cloudflare
  Pages Functions for the forms adapter (`FORM-CONTRACT.md`). Adding any
  other runtime service requires re-planning (`INV-009`, minimum
  defensible architecture).

## Invariants

- Static output remains portable to any static host — the
  Cloudflare-specific piece is scoped to the Functions adapter alone
  (`ARCHITECTURE-PROPOSAL-V3.md` §12), preserving `FORM-CONTRACT.md`'s
  rewrite-avoidance guarantee at the deployment layer too.
- Production deployment requires the full CI gate set to pass first — no
  direct-to-production deployment path bypassing CI exists.

## Forbidden behavior

- Committing a Cloudflare API token or account credential to the
  repository.
- Activating Cloudflare Pages Functions before a real form exists.
- Adding a runtime service (database, server process) without a new
  architecture decision record.
- Deploying to production on a red CI run.

## Validation method

- GitHub Actions workflow gates production deployment on the full
  `CI-CONTRACT.md` gate set passing.
- A future post-deploy smoke check (Stage 4) verifies the production
  deployment actually serves the expected build before considering the
  deployment complete.

## Owner

Track C. Not gated by Track B.

## Dependency

`CI-CONTRACT.md` (deployment gating). `FORM-CONTRACT.md` (Functions
activation trigger). `ASSET-CONTRACT.md` (font self-hosting).

## Change authority

Adding a runtime service beyond static hosting + Functions requires a new
architecture decision, following the same DECISION/WHY/ALTERNATIVES/
EVIDENCE/REVERSIBILITY/RISK/CONSEQUENCE format used in
`ARCHITECTURE-PROPOSAL-V3.md`.

## Evidence required

`EV-20260826-018` (Cloudflare deployment decision).

## Reversibility

MODERATE. Static output is portable; only the Functions adapter is host-
specific, and it sits behind `FORM-CONTRACT.md`'s own adapter boundary —
so even the Cloudflare-specific piece is designed to be swappable without
a UI rewrite.

## Amendment, 2026-08-27: HOST is Cloudflare Workers (static assets), not Pages

**What changed:** `HOST` above reads `Cloudflare Pages`. The actual owner
action taken this date, live in the Cloudflare dashboard (photographed and
supplied directly), was Workers Builds' "Connect to a repository" flow
against a pre-existing Worker named `uk-bangla-tigers` (created in the
account 2026-08-10, verified via the Cloudflare MCP connector's
`workers_list`/`workers_get_worker`) — production branch `main`, deploy
command `npx wrangler deploy`. That is Cloudflare Workers, a different
product from Cloudflare Pages, not a rewording of the same one.

**Why this doesn't require a new architecture decision record:** the
static-output architecture this contract exists to protect is unchanged —
`apps/web` still builds to `output: 'static'`, no adapter, no Functions,
no runtime service. Per Cloudflare's own current guidance
(`developers.cloudflare.com/workers/framework-guides/web-apps/astro/`,
queried 2026-08-27), a purely static Astro site needs no
`@astrojs/cloudflare` adapter at all under Workers — only a Wrangler
config naming an `assets.directory`. This is a delivery-mechanism
substitution (Workers' static-assets serving in place of Pages' static
hosting), not the runtime-service expansion `INV-009`/"Change authority"
above gates.

**What was added, this commit:**
- `wrangler.jsonc` **at the repository root** — `name: "uk-bangla-tigers"`
  (matches the existing Worker exactly, so `wrangler deploy` targets it
  rather than creating a new one), `assets.directory: "./apps/web/dist"`,
  no `main` entry (static-only, no Worker script needed). Originally
  placed at `apps/web/wrangler.jsonc`; moved to root after build
  `55c1d854` proved that wrong — see the correction below.
- `wrangler` as a pinned `apps/web` devDependency (Cloudflare's own
  documented convention: "Workers Builds will use the Wrangler version
  set in your package.json") + a matching
  `scripts/dependency-allowlist.json` entry.

### Correction, same date: the config was in the wrong place

Builds `2a9ae32b` (commit `754612a`) and `55c1d854` (commit `c6e0725`)
both failed. The build log — supplied by the owner, since Cloudflare
does not put it in the GitHub check output — gives the cause exactly:

```
Executing user deploy command: npx wrangler versions upload
✘ [ERROR] Missing entry-point to Worker script or to assets directory
```

Two independent faults, both in dashboard build settings, neither in the
repository's code:

1. **Build command was `None`.** Nothing ran `pnpm run build`, so
   `apps/web/dist` did not exist at deploy time.
2. **Deploy command was the bare default** (`npx wrangler versions
   upload`, the non-production variant) run from Root directory `/`.
   Wrangler resolves its config relative to the directory it runs in, so
   a config at `apps/web/wrangler.jsonc` was never found. The earlier
   recommendation above — pass `-c apps/web/wrangler.jsonc` — would have
   worked, but it required the owner to edit three dashboard fields and
   left the repository broken under Cloudflare's own defaults.

**Fix applied repository-side:** `wrangler.jsonc` moved to the repository
root with `assets.directory: "./apps/web/dist"`. Both default commands
now resolve with no flags, verified locally against the real build output
(`npx wrangler deploy --dry-run` and `npx wrangler versions upload
--dry-run`, each reading 49 files from `apps/web/dist`). This reduces the
required dashboard change from three fields to one.

**Note on what the log disproves.** The failure was *not* caused by
`main` being empty. The log shows `Scope: all 3 workspace projects` and
495 packages installed — Cloudflare cloned and installed the feature
branch, not `main`, and ran the *non-production* deploy command, which is
what Workers Builds uses for a non-production branch. The build got as
far as a successful `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` and failed only at
the deploy step.

**What is still genuinely open:**
- **One dashboard field must still be set by the owner** (Settings →
  Build): Build command = `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile && pnpm run
  build`. Cloudflare explicitly does not honour a `build` block in the
  Wrangler config for Workers Builds
  (`developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/builds/configuration/`), so
  this cannot be fixed from the repository. Root directory stays `/`;
  both deploy commands can now stay at their defaults.
- **`main` is still not a viable production branch**, for a reason
  unrelated to the above: it holds only `README.md`, because PR #1 (63
  commits) has never been merged and `main` has no branch protection
  (`docs/11-github-branch-protection.md`). Deployments will keep coming
  from the feature branch as preview versions until that PR merges.
- No production deploy has been executed or verified from this session.
  The `HOST` line above is left as originally written for the historical
  record; this amendment is the current truth.

## Amendment, 2026-08-27 (later same day): Worker renamed, `wrangler.jsonc` updated to match

**What changed:** the owner renamed the connected Worker, in the
Cloudflare dashboard, from `uk-bangla-tigers` to `ukbt-uk-bangla-tigers`
(confirmed via the Cloudflare MCP connector's `workers_list` — same
Worker `id.tag` `2aa808c47b0040a5a19b23aa0153ea0d` throughout, only the
`name` field and `modified_on` changed). The dashboard surfaced this
itself: a build-settings banner offered to auto-generate a PR updating
`wrangler.jsonc`'s `name` to the new value, per Cloudflare's documented
"Worker name must match `name` in the Wrangler config" build-fail mode
(`developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/builds/troubleshoot/#workers-name-requirement`).

Every Workers Build on every branch had been failing instantly (0-second
duration, no build steps ever ran, no log output) since the deployment
wiring landed — consistent with this exact pre-build validation failing,
not a code defect. `wrangler.jsonc`'s `name` is updated to
`ukbt-uk-bangla-tigers` in this same commit rather than waiting on
Cloudflare's auto-PR.

**Also confirmed empty in the dashboard at the same time:** the **Build
command** field showed `None` — never set to the
`pnpm install --frozen-lockfile && pnpm run build` value this contract
already called out above as owner-required. Both fixes are needed
together; the name fix alone does not make the build produce output, and
the build-command fix alone would still fail Cloudflare's pre-build name
check.

## Amendment, 2026-08-27 (third): `workers-deploy` GitHub Actions job — missing install step, then missing root-level `wrangler`

**What changed:** a second, independent deploy path exists alongside
Cloudflare's own Workers Builds — `.github/workflows/ci.yml`'s
`workers-deploy` job, which runs `cloudflare/wrangler-action@v4` on every
push to `main` after the full CI gate set passes. Investigating an
instant failure in that job (`Unable to locate executable file: pnpm`)
surfaced two stacked defects, fixed as two separate commits:

1. The job checked out the repo and downloaded the built `dist/` artifact
   but never ran `pnpm install` at all — so `pnpm`/Node were present
   (`pnpm/action-setup`, `actions/setup-node`) but no `node_modules`
   existed for `wrangler-action` to find `wrangler` in. Fixed by adding
   `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` immediately before the deploy step.
2. With `node_modules` now present, `wrangler-action`'s own
   `pnpm exec wrangler --version` check still failed
   (`ERR_PNPM_RECURSIVE_EXEC_FIRST_FAIL`), and its fallback install
   attempt (`pnpm add wrangler@4`) failed too
   (`ERR_PNPM_ADDING_TO_ROOT`) — verified against the actual job log, not
   assumed. Root cause: `wrangler` was declared only in
   `apps/web/package.json`, but both `wrangler-action` and Cloudflare's
   own dashboard deploy command run `pnpm exec`/`npx wrangler` from the
   **repository root** (where `wrangler.jsonc` lives, per the first
   amendment above). A devDependency declared in a workspace member is
   invisible to `pnpm exec`/`pnpm add` invoked at the workspace root; pnpm
   also refuses to silently add a dependency to the root package without
   an explicit `-w` flag neither action passes. Fixed by declaring
   `wrangler` as a root-level devDependency too (kept in `apps/web` as
   well — nothing requires removing it there), verified locally: `pnpm
   exec wrangler --version` now resolves to `4.126.0` from the repo root,
   and `npx wrangler deploy --dry-run` reads all 49 files from
   `apps/web/dist` and reports `--dry-run: exiting now` with no error.

This is the same root cause the first amendment's `DEPLOYMENT-CONTRACT.md`
prose already named for Cloudflare's own dashboard build path ("Workers
Builds will use the Wrangler version set in your package.json") without
it being fixed there yet either — `npx wrangler` silently falls back to
the latest published version when it can't find a local install, which is
why the dashboard path deployed successfully despite the same underlying
mismatch; `wrangler-action` has no such silent fallback and fails hard
instead. Declaring `wrangler` at root fixes the pinned-version gap for
both paths, not just the GitHub Actions one.

**Not yet confirmed:** the actual `workers-deploy` job run on the push
that carries this fix. Verify against the next push-to-main CI run's
"Workers deploy (GitHub Actions)" job conclusion before treating this as
resolved.

## Amendment, 2026-08-31: `workers-deploy` confirmed reliable — 10 consecutive successful runs, including auto-deploy of real site content

**What changed:** the previous amendment's open verification item is
closed. Queried GitHub Actions directly (`mcp__github__actions_list` /
`actions_get`, not assumed from the workflow file alone) for every
push-to-`main` `CI` run since the root-level-`wrangler` fix
(`f8d030c`, 2026-08-27T05:33:36Z). Result: **every run since has
succeeded**, `workers-deploy` included — 10 consecutive green runs, most
recently the three merges that landed the hierarchical `CLAUDE.md` split,
the visual-truth governance system, and the client corrections + Uppsala
Tigers roster/photos (PRs #19, #21, #20, 2026-08-31T04:02-04:24Z).

Cross-checked against the Worker itself, independent of the CI log:
`workers_get_worker`/`workers_list` (Cloudflare MCP connector) reports
`ukbt-uk-bangla-tigers`'s `modified_on` as `2026-08-31T04:24:51Z` — the
exact same second the "Deploy Workers" step of run `33356743132`'s
`workers-deploy` job completed (`04:24:44Z`–`04:24:51Z`). Two independent
sources (GitHub's own job-conclusion record and Cloudflare's own resource
metadata) agree, not just one.

**Conclusion:** auto-deploy on merge to `main` is CONFIRMED WORKING, via
the GitHub-Actions-driven path (`workers-deploy` job,
`cloudflare/wrangler-action@v4`, `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`/
`CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` GitHub Actions secrets) — every merge to `main`
now goes through the full `CI-CONTRACT.md` gate set and, only if every
gate passes, deploys the built `apps/web/dist` to the live Worker. This
is the mechanism this contract's `PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT = on merge to the
default branch` line describes; it is satisfied.

**What is still genuinely open, and cannot be closed from this session:**
- **Cloudflare's own dashboard-native "Workers Builds" Git integration**
  (the *separate* path the first 2026-08-27 amendment describes — the
  dashboard's own "Connect to a repository" flow, with its own Build
  command field) is a second, independent trigger on the same Worker.
  This session has no tool access to the Cloudflare dashboard's Build
  settings UI, so its current enabled/disabled state and whether its
  Build command field was ever actually set cannot be verified here. It
  does **not** block the confirmed-working GitHub Actions path above —
  production deploys do not depend on it. But if it is still connected
  and its Build command is still unset, it likely still fails on every
  push (the exact `Missing entry-point to Worker script or to assets
  directory` failure the first amendment diagnosed), producing a
  confusing "failed build" notification in the Cloudflare dashboard next
  to a site that actually deployed fine via GitHub Actions. **Owner
  action, dashboard-only:** check Cloudflare dashboard → Workers &
  Pages → `ukbt-uk-bangla-tigers` → Settings → Build, and either set the
  Build command (`pnpm install --frozen-lockfile && pnpm run build`) so
  it succeeds too, or disconnect the Git integration entirely so
  `workers-deploy` is the single, unambiguous deploy path. Either
  resolves the confusion; neither is required for the live site to keep
  working.
- Branch protection on `main` — status not re-verified this session (no
  branch-protection-reading tool was available); treat `docs/11-github-
  branch-protection.md`'s prior finding (`protected: false`) as
  potentially stale rather than reconfirmed current.
